# AbstractGeometryTest
A test of abstract classes, abstract methods, and so on.


***TO RUN:
open Launcher.java in an IDE or in a terminal, and run the program. :D




In this particular demonstration, I'm working on Abstract Classes. 
This example comes from Pearson's Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, 12e
by Y. Daniel Liang.


I first implement an Abstract Class - Geometric Object.

This class has several attributes and methods that all Geometric Objects might share.

Then I implemented the Abstract Methods in the Abstract Class, namely getArea and getPerimeter.

Then I wrote a Circle class and a Rectangle class, and then implemented 
the overriden methods from the Abstract Class and then I made a Launcher class, for running tests on the objects.

Please let me know if you found this code useful or interesting, and thank you for reading!
